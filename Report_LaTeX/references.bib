abstract = "The role of the total solids (TS) content on anaerobic digestion was investigated in batch reactors. A range of TS contents from 10% to 35% was evaluated, four replicates were performed. The total methane production slightly decreased with TS concentrations increasing from 10% to 25% TS. Two behaviors were observed at 30% TS: two replicates had similar performances to that at 25% TS; for the two other replicates, the methane production was inhibited as observed at 35% TS. This difference suggested that 30% TS content corresponded to a threshold of the solids content, above which methanogenesis was strongly inhibited. The Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) was used to describe the experimental data. The effects of hydrolysis step and liquid/gas mass transfer were particularly investigated. The simulations showed that mass transfer limitation could explain the low methane production at high TS, and that hydrolysis rate constants slightly decreased with increasing TS."
